<section class="cs1999-tasks">

  <div class="task">
    <h2>0-GET Get the source code</h2>
    <p>
      I forked the repo on GitHub and then used 'clone repository', via GitHub Desktop, to make a local copy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once the repo was on my own machine I was able to commit changes to version control
      as I went along, and I pushed back up to my GitHub repo at the end of each day.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="task">
	<h2>0-RUN Get app running and view it in a browser</h2>
	<p>
		<!-- sentence on _how_ you fixed it -->
	</p>
	<p>
		<!-- sentence(s) on anything interesting/incomplete you did -->
	</p>
  </div>

  <div class="task">
	<h2>0-CHANGE Make a change to a template and see it appear</h2>
	<p>
		<!-- sentence on _how_ you fixed it -->
	</p>
	<p>
		<!-- sentence(s) on anything interesting/incomplete you did -->
	</p>
  </div>

  <div class="task">
	<h2>1-ADD Add more data to the form</h2>
	<p>
		<!-- sentence on _how_ you fixed it -->
	</p>
	<p>
		Had an issue with starting <code>init_db.py</code>, the first time round. After trying to launch it again, it now correctly works. I've also added more options to the buggy form.
	</p>
  </div>

  <div class="task">
	<h2>1-VALID Add basic data validation</h2>
	<p>
		Added a while loop with an else clause to prevent non-digit entries into the 'Number of wheels' box as a form of validation. Also limited the pattern choices to a set drop down list and the colour options to a colour picker - this would prevent any unwanted entries.
	</p>
	<p>
		<!-- sentence(s) on anything interesting/incomplete you did -->
	</p>
  </div>

  <div class="task">
	<h2>1-STYLE Style your editor just how you like it</h2>
	<p>
		Made changes to the CSS file as per personal choice.
	</p>
	<p>
		 I personally like a flatter and cleaner looking UI.
	</p>
  </div>

  <div class="task">
	<h2>2-EDIT Edit the record by loading its current values into the form</h2>
	<p>
		The previous entry is show in the entry form for ease of use.
	</p>
	<p>
		<!-- sentence(s) on anything interesting/incomplete you did -->
	</p>
  </div>

  <div class="task">
	<h2>2-FORM Make the form better</h2>
	<p>
		Fixed the flag pattern issue, regarding the specification-accurate values.
	</p>
	<p>
		Otherwise, the form was already quite user friendly like with the colour picker for the buggy colours.
	</p>
  </div>

  <div class="task">
	<h2>2-COST Calculate and save the game cost of the buggy</h2>
	<p>
		<!-- sentence on _how_ you fixed it -->
	</p>
	<p>
		<!-- sentence(s) on anything interesting/incomplete you did -->
	</p>
  </div>

  <div class="task">
	<h2>2-RULES Add validation according to the game rules</h2>
	<p>
		<!-- sentence on _how_ you fixed it -->
	</p>
	<p>
		<!-- sentence(s) on anything interesting/incomplete you did -->
	</p>
  </div>

  <div class="task">
	<h2>3-ENV Switch between dev and production environments</h2>
	<p>
		Skipped to 3-MULTI
	</p>
	<p>
		<!-- sentence(s) on anything interesting/incomplete you did -->
	</p>
  </div>

  <div class="task">
	<h2>3-AUTOFILL Add auto-fill to the edit forms</h2>
	<p>
		Skipped to 3-MULTI
	</p>
	<p>
		My form already autofills with the previous user choices or the default values that the server would assign anyways. But this is not the same as randomised options.
	</p>
  </div>

  <div class="task">
	<h2>3-MULTI Allow different buggies to be created</h2>
	<p>
		I've made an attempt at 3-MULTI and got multiple buggies saved to the database.
	</p>
	<p>
		I switched from using fetchone() to using fetchall(). This unfortunately broke my cost() function and it is now stuck calculating for the first buggy stored in the database for all the buggies. I also did not manage to give the user a way to edit their buggies.
